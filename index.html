            <p>Welcome to my Nick Drake tribute page!</p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Nick Drake was an English folk singer/songwriter whose enduring and enchanting music is cited to this day
                as
                a major influence by musicians from a broad array of genres. Virtually unknown in his lifetime, his
                music
                gained the cult status it still enjoys today only after his tragic death in 1974 aged just 26 as a
                result of
                profound and chronic mental illness.

            <h2>Studio albums</h2>
            <p>Nick Drake's music career spanned just five years from 1969 to 1974. In this time he produced three
                impressive but hugely contrasting studio albums. From the bright, optimistic and richly-produced Five
                leaves
                left, to the stark, pared-down sound and at times bitterly self-critical lyrics of Pink Moon, Drake's
                music
                tells the story of his mental decline and suffering.</p>
